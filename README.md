# dzn_IWB
Arma 3 Infantry Weapon Behaviour tweak

## v1
- UGL Attack

## v2
Task:
  - [IN TEST] Do not check cahced units
  - [IN TEST] Add Hand Grenade sequence
  - [IN TEST] Add Supressive fire sequence
  - [IN TEST] Add move to cover behavior
  - [IN TEST] Locality in MP / Headless

Bugs/Features:
  - Suppress attack: Remeber last target and if no new targets and target alive and in range -> use as new target
  - [IN TEST] UGL: Randomize target position and implement distance accuracy nerf; implement last known attack position aiming boost. Not working =( Try to drop aiming accuracy/shake skill dramatically to 0.05...0.1
  - [IN TEST] Handcuffed / Surrendered units should avoid IWB attacks
